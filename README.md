# Caro - 19 x 19 Tic Tac Toe

### Description

This is a multiplayer Caro game for web browsers. Two players enter into a matchmaking lobby and then play a game. The server saves a user's scores and displays them to players after their match.

The front-end is written in TypeScript and the back-end is written in Java. The server and client stay in constant contact through a websocket connection. I made my own templating system for this project because I didn't know about React or Handlebars at the time.
